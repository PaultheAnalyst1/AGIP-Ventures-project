📊 Analysis Workflow

* Data Cleaning: I began by importing the raw sales dataset into MySQL and performing thorough cleaning. This included handling currency signs, creating new columns, correcting inconsistent column names, standardizing date formats, and ensuring proper data types for sales amounts and product ID.
                            
* Data Modelling: I structured the dataset into models using queries. By using SQL CASE statements, aggregation, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY keywords, I modeled customer demographics, payment method efficiency, revenue generated by location, and more.
                            
* Data Interpretation: From the analysis, I identified peak market purchases, top-performing products, and customers' age groups contributing most to revenue. The insights highlighted gender distribution, and guided recommendations for targeted expansion.
